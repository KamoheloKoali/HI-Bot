# HI-Bot (Holberton School Intranet Bot)

HI-Bot is a bot meant to be used by Holberton School students. It goes onto the Holberton School Intranet with the aim of retrieving the name of the repository, directory and files needed for the current project and creates the directory and files found on the intranet under the specified repository. This is to automate the creation of directories and files needed for a project.


## Install

Clone HI-Bot

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KamoheloKoali/HI-Bot.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd HI-Bot
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage/Examples

<b><i>HI-Bot only works using Google Chrome</i></b>, so please install it if you do not already have it installed.

In order for HI-Bot to create the directory and files in the repository defined on the Holberton School intranet correctly, the repository must be cloned locally and must be relative to the HI-Bot repository.

Example: 

![Example Screenshot](./img/image.png)

Inside HI-Bot's repository, create a .env.local file and write your student email and password because they are needed to get through the login form.

``` bash
  STUDENT_EMAIL="..."
  STUDENT_PASSWORD="..."
```

Inside HI-Bot's repository, you can then run HI-Bot using

``` bash
  python3 main.py <enter which curriculum to go to(part 1, part 2 or part 3 e.t.c)>
```
Or

``` bash
  python3 main.py <enter which curriculum to go to(part 1, part 2 or part 3 e.t.c)> <full path to installation directory for chrome>
```

Example:

``` bash
  python3 main.py part 3
```

OR

``` bash
  python main.py part 3
```

Once you run it, it should open up a Google Chrome window. For HI-Bot to get past the Cloudflare CAPTCHA, it needs your help. All you need to do is take the Cloudflare CAPTCHA test.
